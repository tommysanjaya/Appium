# Appium
Appium is an open-source automation tool for mobile applications. It allows developers and testers to automate the testing of mobile applications on different platforms (iOS, Android) using a single codebase written in various programming languages. Appium supports both native and hybrid mobile apps and provides a consistent API, making it easier to write tests that work across different mobile platforms.

Tech Stack Used for this Mobile Automation:
- IDE: Eclipse
- Framework: Appium, Selenium, TestNG
- Language: Java
- Supporting Application: AppiumInspector, AndroidStudio

# Initial Setup:
1.	Install Java, Android Studio, Node
2.	Setup Java, Android SDK, Node Home path in Windows System (Environment Variable)
3.	Setup Android Virtual Device on Android Studio
4.	Install Appium via CMD (npm install -g Appium)
5.	Install Eclipse
6.	Install Appium Inspector
   
# Pre-Automation
1.	Create Maven Project (maven-archetype-quickstart)
2.	On Eclipse Add Maven Repository / Dependencies to pom.xml file:
    - Java Client (io.appium)
    - TestNG
    - Selenium Support
4.	Install via CMD: 
    - For Android: uiautomator2 -> “appium driver install uiautomator2”
    - For iOS: xcuitest -> “appium driver install xcuitest”
5.	On Eclipse create new Class in src/test/java folder -> Name it as “BaseTest”, and add @BeforeClass annotation (So for every test we run, this BeforeClass will run first)
6.	Set the Device:
    - UiAutomator2Options options = new UiAutomator2Options()
    - options.setDeviceName("deviceNameInAndroidStudio")
7.	Set the APK:
    - Under src/test/java folder create a new folder resource
    - Put the apk file in resource folder
    - options.setDeviceName(path to apk file)
8.	Create new AndroidDriver object -> AndroidDriver driver = new AndroidDriver(url,options)
9.	Create Method inside the BaseTest named TearDown(); Inside this put driver.quit(); And add @AfterClass (for every test we run, at the end this AfterClass will be executed)
10.	Start the Appium Server via CMD (“appium”)
11.	Open and Configure Appium Inspector:
    - Set the App location
    - Set the Device
    - Set the Platform
    - Set automationName (UiAutomator2)
12.	Click Start to Start Inspecting Element on Android Application

# Start your Automation:
1.	Create a Java Class in src/test/java -> this will be our test case
2.	In the class, add Extends BaseTest. To inherit all the setup we need to run the Test Case
3.	inside the class add @Test annotation
4.	Start to Create the Automation Script (driver.findElementBy)
5.	To run the test case, Click Run As -> TestNG Test
